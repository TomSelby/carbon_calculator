Very much work in progress here are 
Notes for improvement:
  1. Include some backend server side code to control API keys- atm just restricting the maps API key heavily and it is front facing.
  2. Make some stats using firebase realtime database on the homepage
  3. Contol rules for firebase database to improve security
  4. Implement transit calculation
  5. Sanitize user input better
  6. Build some style into css so looks nicer
  7. Add so only valid crsid can use website- or add login step
  8. Manage firebase rules
  9. Give the option of multiple routes
